# Forest Fire Classification (FFC) Models: EMUFireNet1 and EMUFireNet2, Best Weights, and Train and Test Datasets

This repository includes: 

  1) The "EMUTrDat" dataset used for training EMUFireNet1 and EMUFireNet2,
  2) The custom EMU Forest Fire (EMUFF) dataset used for testing robustness and accuracy of proposed forest fire classification models,
  3) The repository also provides the model weights for EMUFireNetv1 and EMUFireNetv2 while using EMUTrDat.
  
  
  
  
  
Custom EMUFF Dataset which is used to test how well a model generalizes to unseen data has two classes: Fire and NoFire.
There are 1,830 images under the Fire and 1,776 under the NoFire class. 

"EMUTrDat" dataset which is used for training both models also has two classes and contains 10,800 Fire and 11,144 NoFire 
images.
